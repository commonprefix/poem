\section{Construction}
In our construction, we only modify the chain adoption rule
of the original Bitcoin protocol.
In the original protocol, each honest party starts a round with a local chain
$C$ and checks for incoming messages. If a longer valid chain is received, then
the party adopts it. This comparison is done using function \maxvalid,
which returns the ``best" chain when given a set of chains as input.
In Algorithm~\ref{alg.backbone} Line~\ref{alg-backbone.maxvalid}, the
\maxvalid function is provided with chain $C$ and all the other chains received at that
round ($\bar M[i])$.

In Algorithm~\ref{alg.maxvalid}, we modify the \maxvalid function to return the valid
chain with the most intrinsic work instead of the longest one. The intrinsic work
of a chain is calculated using the \work function (Algorithm~\ref{alg.work}).
In \maxvalid, the same chain validation rules apply as before. In order to
validate a chain, in Line~\ref{alg-maxvalid:validate}, the \validate function is used.
The \validate function (Algorith~\ref{alg.validate}) remains unchanged compared to
the original Bitcoin protocol.
