\section{Disscusion}
Although PoEM is a new consensus mechanism, it is compatible with other
previously proposed improvements upon PoW. We anticipate that the improvement in confimation delay,
throughput, and tolerance to orphans will likely be additive to any of these
existing proposals. 

Interestly, the entropy measurement used by PoEM converges to a physically
meaningful quantity, specifically the expected number of hashes needed to
reproduce a chain of equivalent or greater weight.  This provides a unifying
weighting rule for hierarchical chain constructions such as HLCR \cite{hlcr},
Bitcoin-NG \cite{bitcoinng}, Prism \cite{prism} and fruitchains \cite{fruitchains}. All of these constructions suffer from
needing multiple competing decision metrics, specically both work and time.
However, with PoEM, we believe that the time dependence can be removed from
these constructions. 

PoEM not only provides a simple fork choice rule, but is also a fair mechanism
for weighting entire chains against one another, no matter the complexity of
the graph construction. 

\section{Future work} Future research on PoEM should extend the current
security proof non-zero gamma values. While our current understanding suggests
that a zero gamma represents the least favorable scenario for achieving rapid
concentration, it has nevertheless been proven secure. Interestingly,
experimental data indicates that PoEM performs more effectively with non-zero
gamma values, which appear to have a significant correlation with block
production rates. Thus, a detailed analysis of gamma optimization across
various block production scenarios is warranted.

Moreover, the existing security proof for PoEM needs to be expanded to
accommodate environments with variable difficulty. This expansion should also
include adaptations for partially synchronous and asynchronous models,
broadening the scope and applicability of PoEM's security framework.

Lastly, PoEM presents a novel approach to consensus in blockchain networks,
particularly in hierarchically and partially ordered graph structures. The
potential of PoEM in these settings is significant, and as such, a thorough
investigation into its security and liveness within such structures is
essential.
