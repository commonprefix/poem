\section{Model}

We analyze the protocol using the model introduced in the Bitcoin Backbone~\cite{backbone} paper.
The protocol execution is separated in distinct rounds.
We assume a synchronous communication network, where all messages are eventually
delivered with delay less than a round.
We also assume a static setting, where the protocol is executed by
a fixed number of $n$ players.
The adversary controls $t$ of the players.
In a single round, all players are allowed the same number of queries to
a random oracle as well as communicating with other player through an
unauthenticated network, meaning that the adversary can ``spoof"
the source address of any message that is delivered.
