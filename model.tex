\section{Model}

We analyze the protocol using the model introduced in the Bitcoin Backbone~\cite{backbone} paper.
The protocol execution is separated in distinct rounds.
We assume a synchronous communication network, where all honestly produced
messages are delivered with a delay of one round (messages sent in a round
arrive at the beginning of the next round).
We also assume a static setting, where the protocol is executed by
a fixed number of $n$ players.
The adversary controls $t$ of the players.
In a single round, all players are allowed the same number $q$ of queries to
a random oracle $H$ as well as communicating with other player through an
%TODO: cite random oracle rogaway
%TODO: define security parameter kappa and state that random oracle provides uniform output,
%      hence the maximum entropy is kappa
unauthenticated network, meaning that the adversary can ``spoof"
the source address of any message that is delivered.
