\begin{abstract}
  We propose a modification to the proof-of-work fork choice rule.
  Instead of choosing the heaviest chain, we choose the chain with the most
  \emph{intrinsic work}. The intrinsic work of a block is roughly the number of
  zeroes at the front of its hash. This modification allows us to safely
  decrease the confirmations required,
  yielding a $39.9\%$ improvement in \emph{confirmation delay} or, dually,
  safely increase the block production rate,
  yielding a $16.3\%$ improvement in \emph{throughput} as compared to the vanilla
  Bitcoin proof-of-work fork choice rule. Our modification is at the
  level of the proof-of-work inequality, and thus can be composed with
  any other methods to improve latency or throughput that have been
  proposed throughout the years. We report the experimental findings by
  measuring them on a production-grade implementation of our system,
  which is already deployed in the wild. Lastly, we formally prove the
  security of our new protocol in the Bitcoin Backbone model.
