  We propose a modification to the fork choice rule of proof-of-work blockchains.
  Instead of choosing the heaviest chain, we choose the chain with the most
  \emph{intrinsic work}. The intrinsic work of a block is roughly the number of
  zeroes at the front of its hash. This modification allows us to safely
  decrease the confirmations required,
  yielding a roughly $20\%$ improvement in \emph{confirmation delay} as compared
  to Bitcoin for adversaries close to $10\%$. At these
  improved latency configurations, PoEM also performs better in terms of
  \emph{throughput}, yielding a roughly $14\%$ improvement. Our modification is at the
  level of the proof-of-work inequality, and thus can be composed with
  any other methods to improve latency or throughput that have been
  proposed in the literature (e.g., GHOST).
  We compile detailed simulation evidence from over $2$ billion
  monte carlo executions of our system across different parameters
  to support our claims.
  We formally prove the
  security of our new protocol in the Bitcoin Backbone model.
  These proofs use a new technical tool, the \emph{real-valued Random Oracle}
  which may be of independent interest.
