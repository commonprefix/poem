\begin{abstract}
  We propose a modification to the proof-of-work fork choice rule.
  Instead of choosing the longest chain, we choose the chain with the most
  \emph{intrinsic work}. The intrinsic work of a block is roughly the number of
  zeroes at the front of its hash. This modification allows us to increase
  the block production rate without sacrificing adversarial resilience,
  yielding a $39.9\%$ improvement in confirmation delay and
  a $16.3\%$ improvement in throughput as compared to the vanilla
  Bitcoin proof-of-work fork choice rule. Our modification is at the
  level of the proof-of-work inequality, and thus can be composed with
  any other methods to improve latency or throughput that have been
  proposed throughout the years.
