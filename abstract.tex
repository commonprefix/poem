   Proof-of-Entropy-Minima (PoEM) is novel fork choice rule which incorporates
  \emph{intrinsic work} to more efficiently resolve forks.  Intrinsic work measures 
  the number of states a block removes from the possible chain progression paths, 
  corresponding to the entropy removed from the system.  
  Finally, it is shown PoEM increases the block production rate while improving adversarial resilience,
  yielding a $2\times$ improvement in confirmation delay, compared to the heaviest chain rule.
  \atnote{Revisit the $2\times$ number when we know it.}
