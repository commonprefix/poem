\begin{abstract}
  We propose a modification to the proof-of-work fork choice rule.
  Instead of choosing the longest chain, we choose the chain with the most
  \emph{intrinsic work}. The intrinsic work of a block is the number of
  zeroes at the front of its hash. This modification allows us to increase
  the block production rate without sacrificing adversarial resilience,
  yielding a $2\times$ improvement in confirmation delay.
  \atnote{Revisit the $2\times$ number when we know it.}
