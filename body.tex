Entropy, a Shannon-theoretic quantity employed heavily in statistics and information theory, measures the "compressability" and inherent information content of a random variable, and entropy-rate that of a random process. Any blockchain's evolution is that of a random process. In the classical proof-of-work (PoW) setting, an associated POW function (often a hash function) has $2^k$ states, and is (approximately, if well designed) uniformly distributed across these states. Thus, the maximum entropy associated with hashed outputs is $H_{max} = 2^k$, corresponding to no "work" performed on the system. The PoW algorithm restricts acceptable hashed outputs to all values below a threshold difficulty $2^d$. This sets the maximum output target entropy to be $2^d$.

In practice, the mining process achieves a hashed output ($2^c$) is less than or equal to the difficulty threshold, i.e., $2^c \le 2^d$. We call this the intrinsic difficulty, which removes $2^k - 2^c$ possible states from $H_{max}$. The entropic consensus mechanism utilizes the {\em difference entropy} $$\Delta H= k - c$$ using the actual output entropy rather than the target difference entropy.

\section{Algorithm}
\subsection{Definitions}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item $\Delta H$ is Entropy reduced by a given worked block represented in fractional bits
    \item $hash$ is the Hash($B_n$) of a given block that represents the work done on a block. It can vary based on the work functions, but Sha256 is a canonical example.
    \item Genesis = First block in the blockchain
    \item k = Field size of the hash function
\end{enumerate}

\begin{algorithm}
\caption{Intrinsic Difficulty of the block}
\label{Intrinsic_Difficulty}
\begin{algorithmic}[2]
\Require Block
\Ensure Returns the Intrinsic difficulty of the block
\Function{$\Delta H$}{$B_n$}
\State $hash \gets$ Hash($B_n$)
\State $\Delta h \gets k - \log_2(hash)$
\State \Return $\Delta h$
\EndFunction
\end{algorithmic}
\end{algorithm}

\begin{algorithm}
\caption{Total Entropy Reduction}
\label{Total_Entropy_Reduction}
\begin{algorithmic}[3]
\Require Chain, Block Number
\Ensure Returns the sum of Intrinsic difficulties of all the blocks going back to genesis from the given block
\Function{$H$}{$C,n$}
\If{$B_n$ == $B\_genesis$}
    \State \Return $0$
\Else
    \State \Return \Call{$\Delta H$}{$B_n$} +
                    \Call{$H$}{$B_{n-1}$}
\EndIf
\EndFunction
\end{algorithmic}
