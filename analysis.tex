\section{Analysis}

Consider an execution of the \poem protocol.

We define a discrete and uniformly random variable $X_{r, i}$ as follows.
\atnote{$X_{r, i}$ is not uniformly random}
If at round $r$, honest party $P_i$ finds PoW block $B$, then $X_{r, i} = \work(B)$.
If no PoW is found, $X_{r, i} = 0$. We define $X_{r}$ as the maximum PoW intrinsic work
generated by an honest party during round $r$. Hence, $X_{r} = \max_{i = 1}^{n - t}{X_{r,i}}$.

Next, we define a discrete random variable $Z_{r, j, k}$ as follows.
If at round $r$, the $k$-th query of adversarial party $P_j$ is a PoW block $B$, then
$Z_{r, j, k} = \work(B)$. If no PoW is found, $Z_{r, j, k} = 0$. We define $Z_{r}$ as
the sum of all PoW intrinsic work generated by all adversarial party queries
during round $r$. Hence, $Z_{r} = \sum_{j = 1}^{t}{ \sum_{k = 1}^{q}{ Z_{r, j, k} } }$.
\atnote{Maybe call adversarial parties $P_j^{\mathcal{A}}$}

%TODO: Make the conjecture formal.
\begin{conjecture}[\poem is Secure]
  For all PPT adversaries, the \poem protocol, in
  the static setting, utilizing a synchronous communication network, is
  secure except with negligible probability in the security parameter $\kappa$.
\end{conjecture}
